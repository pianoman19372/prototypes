/chef
-----
An example of spinning up a chef server in vagrant and using it to configure my desktop.

some assumptions here:
 1: /storage/git is the pianoman19372/prototypes repo
 2: you've already installed vagrant
 3: you've already downloaded the debs for chef

I'll automate #2 and #3 shortly

User credentials and server names in the Makefile are made up for illustration purposes
